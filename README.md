<h1 align="center">PLC Palletizing System</h1>
<p align="center">PLC-based sorting & palletizing with HMI integration</p>

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **PLC-based palletizing system** developed as a university course project. The system sorts boxes according to their **sizes** and then palletizes them based on predefined logic. The project was later enhanced by adding an **HMI (Human-Machine Interface)** for better monitoring and control.

This project demonstrates:
- Box sorting based on size
- Size-dependent palletizing logic
- Industrial automation principles
- PLC program structure
- HMI integration

---

## 🏭 System Description
The palletizing system is designed to perform the following tasks:
- Detect and classify boxes according to their dimensions
- Route boxes based on size categories
- Execute palletizing operations according to the assigned box type
- Provide a safe and structured palletizing process

The system was initially developed **without an HMI** and later upgraded with **HMI screens** to improve operator interaction and system monitoring.
