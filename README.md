# PLC Box Sorting and Storage System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **PLC-based box sorting and storage system**.  
The system classifies boxes according to their **sizes** and routes them to a **common storage area** based on predefined logic.

The project was designed to include an **HMI (Human-Machine Interface) from the initial development stage**, enabling system monitoring and operator interaction.

This project demonstrates:
- Box sorting based on size
- Size-based routing to a common storage area
- Industrial automation principles
- PLC program structure
- HMI integration

## 🏭 System Description
The box sorting and storage system performs the following tasks:
- Detects and classifies boxes according to their dimensions
- Routes boxes based on size categories
- Directs all box types to a **shared storage area**
- Provides system monitoring and operator interaction via the **HMI**
- Ensures a safe and structured material handling process
